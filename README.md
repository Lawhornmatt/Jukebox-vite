## DESCRIPTION:

This is the ReadMe for Matty Lawhorn, Thomas Le, Juan Gonzales, Andrew Johnson's project #3 titled: Jukebox   

This is the final group project for the UT Austin Full-Stack Web Development Fall 2022 Bootcamp. The challenge was to use a MERN stack to provide a reactive and persistant web app.  

After making an account and signing in, users can either join any public lobby or create their own. In that lobby, users can add YouTube videos to a queue which everyone can watch.

## TOOLS:

Our app has React.js (built in a development environment by Vite) on the front end, has Express with Apollo Client and GraphQL attached to a MongoDB database, and uses Node.js on the backend.
